🔗 Live Demo: [Link] (https://online-eamcet-portal.rf.gd/)

##  About the Project

This is a web-based Online EAMCET Examination Portal developed using PHP and MySQL.

The system was originally designed and implemented for use in my college to conduct entrance-style mock examinations in a structured and automated manner.

It solves real-world problems such as:

- Manual evaluation delays
- Paper-based exam management difficulties
- Lack of centralized question control
- No automated timer enforcement
- Manual result calculation errors

⚠️ This is a demo version deployed for portfolio purposes.
The original production database and sensitive configurations are excluded for privacy and security reasons.
